# Sailing Yacht Paragon

S/Y Paragon website is intended to show people what life on board a sailing yacht is like. The site is aimed at people who are interested in following life at sea and seeing the progress of the boat while travelling around world. It should also give an insite into the type of vessel Paragon is and who the crew are.

## Features

### Current Features


#### Logo 
The Paragon Diamond logo is the boats logo and used around the boat and on ships papers, so it is also used on the website and features on every page as a link back to the home page. 

#### Navigation Menu 
This features at the top of all pages (except the 404 page) and has links to each page, home, boat, adventures, & contact. It also loads on the “thank you” page after the contact form has been filled in to allow users to carry on navigation the site. On a desktop it is displayed horizontally along the top and as the screen size becomes smaller the items will stack vertically. 

#### Hero Images 
Each page features a hero image featuring the boat or scenic locations to give a feel of what life at sea can be like. 

#### Hero Image Text 
There is a text box over the hero image on each page that introduces the user to page and gives a short overview of what that page is about. On a desktop this can will display offset to the left or right depending on the image behind and what works best with that image. On a smaller screen such as a mobile the text box will be more centered to allow for the text to be easily readable.

#### Opening Paragraphs 
The opening paragraphs on the home page and adventures page give a slightly longer explanation of the intentions of the page.  

#### Crew Section 
The crew section gives a brief overview of each of the crew on board, including the dogs, and what their background in sailing is. This is designed as a 2x2 grid layout on desktop but once the screen becomes smaller will stack vertically. 

#### The Boat 
On the boat page are the technically drawing of the yacht and a layout plan to show the user in more details the design of the yacht. Below is a table with the basic specifications of the yacht followed by a selection of photos showing what life is like on board the boat.

#### Our adventures  
This page is designed to give the user the change to see what some of the specific location visited are like. This page is designed using accordions to compress the sections to start with making it easier for the user to navigate to the relevant section. This will become more important as more locations are added and the list becomes longer. 

#### Contact Us  
The contact page features a form for the user to complete if they would like to get in contact. On completion & submission this will re-direct to a “thank-you” page to ensure the user knows that the form has been successfully submitted. All fields are mandatory fields to make sure the user has given enough information to allow a response. 

#### Footer
The footer features on each page and has links to the yachts social media accounts (not yet created so currently links to SM home pages). These links open in a new tab to ensure the user doesn’t lose the original site. 


## New Features to come

#### Hamburger Menu
On smaller screen I believe it would be a more user. friendly experience to use a hamburger menu.

 #### The Crew
Allow the user to click on each crew member to open a full CV as this could also be useful for finding work on other yachts which is done sometimes. 

#### Our Adventures
More locations and larger galleries including videos split into sections – like a ships log

#### The Boat 
Following the technically specification of the yacht I would like to imbed a series of videos which follow the upgrates currently been made to the boat to allow off-grid living in remote locations. Users would be able to use these videos to help with their own conversion works.
