            The coast of the UK has some of the most spectacular coastline in the world. Over the last 5 years we have based ourselves in Chichester Harbour, an area of outstanding natural beauty and special scientific interest on the south coast. With the white sand beaches of East head and the historic villages of Bosham and Dell Quay a short dinghy ride away this seems like a good place to call home for now. 
        </p>
        <p>
            From our base in Chichester we have ventured down to Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly on several occasions as well as further north up to the Western Isles of Scotland. Below are some short snippets of what we have been up to recently.

            <p>Over the Easter weekend of 2022 we set off from Birdham Pool Marina, Chichester towards Scotland. Onboard with us was my good friend Chloe and her son Oliver. While both we’re very keen to join us for the trip neither Chloe or Oliver had any sailing experience. The Irish sea can be a nasty piece of water and very rough at times which can make even seasoned sailors sick. Despite many tales rough nights at sea both we’re keen to come and so we se off……. into 4 days of champagne sailing conditions, blue skies, perfect winds, and dolphins swimming off the bow. 4 days later we arrived in Gihah with Chloe & Oliver wondering what all the fuss was about.</p>

            <p>During the summer of 2022 we spent several months cursing the Western isles of Scotland. Reaching as for north as Stornaway. Unfortunately, the weather lived up to its Scottish reputation and we found ourselves with 3 months of rain and gales. However, the spectacular scenery more than made up for this. Visiting Lewis and Harris, Skye, Mull and Karerra among others. We snorkelled for scallops, hiked with the dogs and drank whisky by the bonfire on the loch side. </p>

            <p>Some of our favourite cursing grounds are western Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. These beautiful islands just 40 miles off the Cornish cost could trick you into thinking you’re in the Caribbean, with turquoise waters and white sand beaches as well as many very friendly seals to swim with. </p>
