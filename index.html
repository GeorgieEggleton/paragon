        <p>
            For the last 5 years we have been living on board Paragon here in the UK. Having both grown up sailing and then following careers at sea, Owain in the Royal Navy, and Georgie as racing yacht crew, living on land didn't seem like the right fit, the opportunity to move our home as we like and explore the world is too tempting.
        </p>
        <p>
            It felt important to us that while travelling we are as environmentally friendly as possible and so wherever possible we will sail to our next destination using the power of the wind. While living aboard we generate as much power as possible from solar panels and wind generators. However, day to day life uses a lot (!) of power, so, before setting off further afield the plans are to make alterations to Paragon to ensure all appliencs are as afficiant as possible and that we can generate even more power than we currently are.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the next year or so we plan to add more wind and solar generators, upgrade the lithium Ion battery bank, and swap out the dirty Diesel engine for an electric drive, meaning we can support ourselves around the world using only the elements!

Now out of the Navy and working for a robotics company his plans are now to use skills to make Paragon as self sufficant and eco-friendly as possible. </p>
